\begin{commentblock}
Handling editor comment:

This paper develops a Bayesian dynamical model approach for river flow forecasting. A reviewer and I have read the manuscript, and although this is an important problem, and the proposed methods are interesting, there are some serious shortcomings of the submitted manuscript that need to be addressed.

\begin{commentblock}
The abstract purports a fast approach to the proposed DQLM framework, but that doesn't seem to be verified anywhere in the manuscript -- what is the computational time and complexity of the proposed method? Once it is fitted, does it need to be reestimated in future months or years? Is it feasible to do so?

One of the main issues with the paper is that the proposed method is not validated properly -- there are no competing alternatives (despite models, A, B and C being listed), the extended asymmetric Laplace is not really given validation either (how does this compare against just an asymmetric Laplace in this problem setting?). I imagine this hierarchical model is likely so complicated that no working hydrologists would understand, nor use it, without very clear evidence that it was substantially superior to other forecast products. The method should be validated against competing statistical models, as well as physical forecast ensembles to illustrate that the predictive distributions are sharper and better calibrated than simpler alternatives.

\begin{commentblock}
This brings me to another point, in that the hierarchical model is fairly detailed. A necessary revision would be to implement versions of the model without various hierarchical pieces -- e.g., Model C, what if the AR trend piece were removed? Or, Model B, what if retrospective and/or all states autoregressions were removed? In the current manuscript, the results look decent, but it's not really clear which part of the model is giving the most "bang for your buck", which is critical for end users to understand.

Again, on validation: include (along with comparisons against alternative models) proper scores quantifying the quality of the predictive distributions. CRPS is used in model estimation, apparently, but why are CRPS scores not reported out for the forecasting exercise? And, how do they change depending on regime? Because this is a quantile-based method, it is fair to include quantile scores as well (see Gneiting and Raftery 2007 for details).

Something that wasn't clear to me in the application was: is this in-sample, or out-of-sample validation? It appears that the model was fit to the data that is being used in validation, which isn't realistic. Please perform an appropriate cross-validation study to investigate the approach's actual ability to forecast unseen data.

The weighted combination of prior forecasts at differing horizons is curious to me. Presumably the most recent forecasts should be better with more available atmospheric data, whereas longer lead-time forecasts likely exhibit more bias. How does the model perform if you only use the most recent forecast (which I would expect to be the highest quality)?

Reviewer comments:

Reviewer 1 Comments to the Author

This paper develops a Bayesian quantile regression approach, based on asymmetric Laplace distributions, to predict and forecast streamflow in the Santa Cruz region of the US. The work appears strong in the development of the Bayesian models and the novelty in the extension of inference methods is accepted. However, the improvement of forecasts through dynamical error correction is a common strategy and the novelty of this part may need to be elucidated further. The paper is framed as a forecasting paper, however the forecasting component is limited and robust forecast evaluation is absent. I recommend that some substantial revisions, mainly structural, are required before proceeding with publication. My comments below don't cover everything, but are intended as a push into reshaping:

\subsection{Reviewer 1 --- Major comments (point-by-point)}

\commentheading{\RoneM{1}}
\begin{commentblock}
In the introduction and elsewhere, the "cascade of uncertainty" is not distinguished between meteorological uncertainty and hydrological uncertainty. This is not necessarily a major problem with a Bayesian model that combines sources of uncertainty, but I find the introduction and motivation less compelling when hydrological and meteorological concepts are mixed. For example, the paragraph that starts off "Hydrological predictions are often produced using physical models..." diverts to discussions of under-dispersion in ensembles and perturbation methods in weather forecasts. I would suggest restructuring the introduction to cover different sources of uncertainty before explaining how uncertainty can be consolidated in a Bayesian framework.

The links between the model formulation and the results are not clear to me. For example, three models (A, B and C) are developed in section 2. It would be helpful to explicitly link the models to the results being discussed in section 3.

\begin{commentblock}
The paper is maths heavy, so it may be beneficial to reduce the equations and mathematical details. The amount of detail given may be highly suitable for a dissertation, but some details are not necessary for a paper. For example, in section 2.7, PITs are described in detail, however, it is followed that CRPS is chosen for model selection instead and PITs are not used. Suggest removing PITs in this case. As another example, no quantile crossing is observed, however a two-step method is presented to "resolve" quantile crossing. I suggest reconsidering how much detail is needed for the Posterior Predictive Synthesis part.

\begin{commentblock}
If I have not misunderstood, only one short forecast has been evaluated for a moderate flood from 2022-12-25 to 2023-01-22. Is it possible to provide more evidence for the use of the model for forecasting high, low and moderate events? Or the continuous period 2023 to present? Going to the previous comment, PITs and CRPS have been used for model selection (section 2.7) rather than forecast verification. I would suggest that in an expanded evaluation of forecast performance that CRPS and PITs would be useful tools.
